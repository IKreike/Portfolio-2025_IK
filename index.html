            <h2>Online Chat</h2>
            <p>API's and web standards</p>
            <p>The web is a wonderful place, and the technologies available today are more powerful than ever before.
                The strength of the web lies in the fact that it is a platform available to everyone and is built on
                open standards. The technologies are designed and specified through consensus and are not controlled by
                any single entity.</p>
            <p>With this project we experienced the power of the web by making a (mobile) web app just as engaging as
                native mobile apps. I made a server-side rendered application, enchanced with the use of content and web
                API's</p>

            <h3>How to use</h3>
            <p>Follow the link to the Render server, where you will be asked to fill in a name to log in. Once done, you
                enter a chatroom with all people currently connected to the server. Send messages to other people (or
                yourself in another window), or use the command</p>
            <p class="code">/random-fact</p>
            <p>or command </p>
            <p class="code">/random-fact [number]</p>

            <p>accesibility, testing and user experience</p>
            <p>The web is for everyone. That means we can create things that everyone can use. But do we really know
                everyone?</p>
            <p>Through the use of the exclusive design principles, I designed a prototype for Darice, a woman who
                became deaf later in life. She would love to experience hearing movies and podcasts again, with all
                hearable details. I was challenged to create a new way to experience sound effects.</p>

            <h3>The project</h3>
            <p>Combining senses like sound and sight makes a project immersive an enticing to the viewer. Combining
                Audio and visual design takes the vieuwer on a trip into the forest displayed, strengened by the
                creatures not being confined by their comic-book boxes.</p>
            <p>This project makes use of a looping comic, with audio design for each panel of the story. This is
                displayed in an Immersive room, where people can stand and see the comic play out around them.</p>

            <p>I found this song when i was studying for the final high school exams. It perfectly portrayes how i felt
                going for a new chapter in my life, and every year since when I have to make big desisions it shows up
                on my desk. Give a listen to it, and maybe it will bring you a sense of reassurance too. Because
                everything will land on its feet in the end.</p>

            <h2>Framer Framed</h2>
            <p>accesibility and teamwork</p>
            <p>In a team of 4 we designd and created a search and discoverysite for the gallery Framer Framed in
                Amsterdam. All items in this enormous database were connected and related to eachother, and we wanted to
                highlight this and allow the users to explore. </p>
            <p>With our focus group being visually impaired and blind people we paid special attention to the keyboard
                functionality of our project. We made sure there are not many links, and link titles were short and
                understandable. </p>
            <img src="./assets/FF-Home.png" alt="">
            <p>The database itself was a challenge, as its structure differentiates between different kinds of subjects.
                We solved this problem by creating different filters and layouts, so every element in the database could
                be covered.</p>
            <p>We paid special attention to the colors used in this project, as we wanted the colors to be distinct in
                every situation. Every color used has a color contrast of 6 or higher against its text color, and the
                pallette is completely colorblind friendly.</p>
