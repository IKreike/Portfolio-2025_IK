            <h2>Online Chat</h2>
            <p>datum</p>
            <p>The web is a wonderful place, and the technologies available today are more powerful than ever before.
                The strength of the web lies in the fact that it is a platform available to everyone and is built on
                open standards. The technologies are designed and specified through consensus and are not controlled by
                any single entity.</p>
            <p>With this project we experienced the power of the web by making a (mobile) web app just as engaging as
                native mobile apps. I made a server-side rendered application, enchanced with the use of content and web
                API's</p>
            <section class="ad">
                <p>The newest chat</p>
                <a href="https://api-ikreike.onrender.com/">Click here to enter the newest chat server – to feel less
                    lonely, a second browser is recommended – not a scam</a>
            </section>
            <h3>How to use</h3>
            <p>Follow the link to the Render server, where you will be asked to fill in a name to log in. Once done, you
                enter a chatroom with all people currently connected to the server. Send messages to other people (or
                yourself in another window), or use the command</p>
            <p class="code">/random-fact</p>
            <p>or command </p>
            <p class="code">/random-fact [number]</p>
            <p>for a fun random fact.</p>

            <p>The web is for everyone. That means we can create things that everyone can use. But do we really know
                everyone?</p>
            <p>Through the use of the exclusive design principles, I designed a prototype for Darice, a woman who
                became deaf later in life. She would love to experience hearing movies and podcasts again, with all
                hearable details. I was challenged to create a new way to experience sound effects.</p>

            <p>I recommend playing the first few seconds of the clip a few times without sound, so you can see the sound
                at it was intended to be. </p>
